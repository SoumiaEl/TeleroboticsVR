## Introduction 

Telepresence, especially through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), represents a significant shift in the field of remote robot control. This modality has shown itself to be highly intuitive and effective, enabling a kind of telepresence that can be beneficial in various contexts, such as potentially hazardous environments for humans, enhancing teamwork, and manipulating remote objects with the help of robots.
