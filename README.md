## Introduction 

Telepresence, especially through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), represents a significant shift in the field of remote robot control. This modality has shown itself to be highly intuitive and effective, enabling a kind of telepresence that can be beneficial in various contexts, such as potentially hazardous environments for humans, enhancing teamwork, and manipulating remote objects with the help of robots.

This repo will offer solutions to the latency issue by introducing a ROS-Unity simulation of a real teleoperation scenario. The objective is to explore new perspectives, evaluate potential methods, and acquaint oneself with emerging technologies that could potentially improve the quality of VR/AR telepresence.

## Installations

To achieve the seamless integration of Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) with remote robot control, a connection between Unity and the Robot Operating System (ROS) will be set up. This section will guide you through the essential steps to establish a reliable ROS-Unity link by using Unity Robotics Hub packages. The remote robot control used in this project is the Franka Emika Panda.
